1. Define Insurance Plans Clearly
   Sure, Iâ€™ll outline two insurance plans for phones: one for expensive phones and one for affordable phones. I'll provide estimated coverage amounts, premium amounts, and deductibles in Kenyan Shillings (KES).

### 1. **Premium Phone Insurance Plan**

**Target Audience**: High-end or flagship phones (e.g., iPhone, Samsung Galaxy S series, etc.)

- **Coverage Amount**: KES 150,000
  - Covers accidental damage, theft, and liquid damage.
- **Premium Amount**: KES 15,000 per year
  - This premium reflects the higher risk and value of insuring expensive phones.
- **Deductible Amount**: KES 10,000
  - The amount the policyholder must pay out-of-pocket before insurance kicks in.

**Rationale**:

- **Coverage Amount**: High coverage limit to match the high value of expensive phones.
- **Premium Amount**: Set at a level that covers the high risk and potential payout while ensuring profitability.
- **Deductible Amount**: Relatively high to discourage small claims and help cover the cost of insurance.

### 2. **Affordable Phone Insurance Plan**

**Target Audience**: Mid-range or budget phones (e.g., Xiaomi, Samsung A series, etc.)

- **Coverage Amount**: KES 30,000
  - Covers accidental damage, theft, and liquid damage.
- **Premium Amount**: KES 4,000 per year
  - Lower premium to match the lower value of affordable phones.
- **Deductible Amount**: KES 3,000
  - A lower deductible to keep the plan attractive and affordable for users of budget phones.

**Rationale**:

- **Coverage Amount**: Lower coverage limit to reflect the lower value of affordable phones.
- **Premium Amount**: Lower to ensure that the insurance remains cost-effective for budget-conscious consumers.
- **Deductible Amount**: Lower to keep the plan appealing to users who might be more price-sensitive.

### Summary Table

| **Plan**                       | **Coverage Amount** | **Premium Amount**  | **Deductible Amount** |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Premium Phone Insurance**    | KES 150,000         | KES 15,000 per year | KES 10,000            |
| **Affordable Phone Insurance** | KES 30,000          | KES 4,000 per year  | KES 3,000             |

These plans balance coverage, affordability, and profitability. Adjustments can be made based on specific market conditions and competition.
